The code you provided is used to identify and count the number of null (missing) values in each column of a DataFrame (df). It then filters and selects columns that have more than one null value.

It looks like you're using the iloc method in pandas to select a subset of columns from your DataFrame (df). Specifically, you're selecting all rows and columns 1 through 3000 (excluding column 3001). The resulting DataFrame is assigned to the variable x, and x.head() is used to display the first few rows of this subset.

It looks like you're using the iloc method again, this time to select the last column of your DataFrame (df). The resulting Series is assigned to the variable y, and y.head() is used to display the first few values of this Series.

    x: This is your feature matrix containing the input variables.
    y: This is your target variable or labels.
    test_size=0.2: This specifies that 20% of the data will be used as the test set, and the remaining 80% will be used as the training set.
    random_state=12: This is used to seed the random number generator. Setting a random state ensures reproducibility, meaning that if you run the code multiple times with the same random state, you'll get the same split each time.

After running this code, you will have four sets of data:

    x_train: The training data for the features.
    x_test: The testing data for the features.
    y_train: The training data for the target variable.
    y_test: The testing data for the target variable.


It looks like you're importing the StandardScaler class from scikit-learn's preprocessing module. The StandardScaler is used for standardizing features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance

. When scaling the data using StandardScaler, you should use the fit_transform method on the training set to calculate the mean and standard deviation and then apply the same transformation to the testing set.

   n_neighbors=5: Specifies the number of neighbors to consider for classification.
   metric='minkowski': The distance metric used for the KNN algorithm. In this case, it's the Minkowski distance.
   p=2: The power parameter for the Minkowski distance (p=2 corresponds to Euclidean distance).
   After running this code, the knn object is trained on your training data (x_train and y_train). You can then use this trained model to make predictions on new data or evaluate its performance on the testing set.

It looks like you've used your trained k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier (knn) to make predictions on the test data (x_test). The predicted values are stored in the variable y_pred_knn. If you want to inspect the predicted values, you can print or view the content of y_pred_knn:

It looks like you're using the confusion_matrix function from scikit-learn to compute the confusion matrix for the predictions made by your k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier on the test set. The confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model.

The resulting cm variable contains the confusion matrix, and you can print it to see the values. The confusion matrix will have four entries:

    True Positive (TP): Number of observations that were correctly predicted as positive.
    True Negative (TN): Number of observations that were correctly predicted as negative.
    False Positive (FP): Number of observations that were incorrectly predicted as positive.
    False Negative (FN): Number of observations that were incorrectly predicted as negative.

t looks like you're using Seaborn and Matplotlib to create a heatmap visualization of your confusion matrix. The code you provided will display a heatmap with annotated values in each cell, using the 'Reds' color map.
This code utilizes Seaborn's heatmap function to visualize the confusion matrix. The annot=True argument adds numerical annotations to each cell, and fmt='.2f' formats the annotations as floating-point numbers with two decimal places. The colormap is set to 'Reds' for better visualization of intensity.
This heatmap can provide a quick visual representation of how well your model is performing in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives

accuracy_score function to calculate the accuracy of your k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier on the test set. The accuracy_score function compares the predicted labels (y_pred_knn) with the true labels (y_test) and computes the accuracy.
The accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances.

It looks like you're using scikit-learn to create and train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel.
    SVC: Stands for Support Vector Classification, and it is used for classification tasks.
    kernel='linear': Specifies that a linear kernel should be used.
    random_state=0: Sets a specific seed for the random number generator for reproducibility.
After running this code, the svc object will be trained on your training data (x_train and y_train).

It appears you have used your trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier (svc) to make predictions on the test data (x_test). The predicted values are stored in the variable y_pred_svc. If you want to inspect the predicted values, you can print or view the content of y_pred_svc

t looks like you're using the confusion_matrix function from scikit-learn to compute the confusion matrix for the predictions made by your Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on the test set

AGAIN HEAPMAP FOR SVM 

K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. In KNN, the prediction for a new data point is made based on the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression) of its k-nearest neighbors in the training dataset. The "closeness" or similarity between data points is typically determined using a distance metric, commonly the Euclidean distance

A support vector machine (SVM) is a type of supervised learning algorithm used in machine learning to solve classification and regression tasks; SVMs are particularly good at solving binary classification problems, which require classifying the elements of a data set into two groups.
